You must find ways to survive in this land of nothing. 
Each time you arrive to a new destination you must find a charging port.
Time is of the essance.... 
The remote will point you in the right direction, but once it dies you will be on your own.
Find the charging port before the battery dies and you could still make it out of here with your life.

There is a Juniper Berry Bush 50 meters away. You see a tipped over empty fishing boat hull a few meters away from the tree.
The remote is telling you the charging port will take 2 days of walking to get to. You have a quarter charge worth of battery left.
Depending on how often the remote is used 1/4 of charge will keep the remote on for two days.

Do you want to make camp for the night?, Continue walking to the charging port?""",

You pull the boat hull over to the tree to make a shelter for the night.
You lean the boat against the tree to help provide a wind break and shelter from any potential rain.

Do you make a fire for the night?, Do you enjoy seeing how bright all the stars are?""",

A few embers blew up into the dried up juniper berry tree and lit the whole tree on fire. 
You wake up and have to get out quickly. While springing out of your makeshift bed, 
you almost forgot the remote in the shelter. When you turn back for the remote the wind blows the fire directly towards you.
You are able to get the remote, but not without injury. You burn your arm right arm and right hand.""",

You begin to think about what you need to do to survive.

You are grateful there is a full moon tonight and you are able to walk in the brightly lit starry night sky.

It has made it much easier to see where you are going. 
You find an aloe vera plant growing and rub it all over your burns helping to soothe your skin.
A small stream of water was close to the aloe vera plant. 
You collect some water, but wait to drink any of it since it needs to be purified.
You are feeling much better now. You are mostly tired and ready to drink some water.
