You must find ways to survive in this land of nothing. 
Each time you arrive to a new destination you must find a charging port.
Time is of the essance.... 
The remote will point you in the right direction, but once it dies you will be on your own.
Find the charging port before the battery dies and you could still make it out of here with your life.

There is a Juniper Berry Bush 50 meters away. You see a tipped over empty fishing boat hull a few meters away from the tree.
You found some rope when you picked up the boat. You decide to hold on to it just in case you need it later.
The remote is telling you the charging port will take 2 days of walking to get to. You have a quarter charge worth of battery left.
Depending on how often the remote is used 1/4 of charge will keep the remote on for two days.
